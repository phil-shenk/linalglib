# linalglib
simple, straightforward linear algebra library for 4D vectors and matrices for use in computer graphics applications

 - matrices are represented in **column-major order** to match the OpenGL convention
 - the homogeneous coordinate system represents 3D vectors with a '0' value in the fourth coordinate, and 3D points with a '1'
